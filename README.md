### Introduction
In this tutorial, I will introduce and give you basic information about the operations of Airbnb, one of the biggest online market for contemporary housing rentals and how hosts can optimize their listings to maximize the profits. All the source codes will be done in Python with emphasis on Data Visualization and Data Analysis. The details will be mentioned below and in source code file, named Final-tutorial.ipynb.

### Project Plan
Since the first time Airbnb was established in 2008, its appearance has disrupted and changed the traditional ways of hospitality and accommodation around the world. The number of rental listings on Airbnb has expanded exponentially over the past few years. Based on the motivation to understand its explosive growth and operation thoroughly, this project will extract data from websites, manipulate it, run exploratory analysis, apply machine learning models to do so. Besides, in the stance of owners, I will try to answer more questions as many as possible to help hosts have the clearest view of Airbnb company and how to strategize their business. Indeed, the project will explore how Airbnb in different cities affect how owners run their business as hosts and how customers will feel and speed their money on Airbnb houses. Finally, with all insights I collect, possible ideas will be suggested to help owners to choose the best options they need.

The project will try to draw a comprehensive picture of Airbnb listings in New York City and then compare its with those of other cities, such as San Francisco or Boston.

### Questions
In details, the project will understand how the locations of these accommodations, ranges of time customers are likely to travel (supply and demand principle), and other reasons may affect the price, ratings, and number of listings. Furthermore, customers' reviews play an important roles in improving customer service, which may help the company run advertisement for suitable targets and connect customers or hosts with same interests. Thus, I want to explore how these reviews can be extracted and briefly identify some characteristics of customers to personalize their experiences.
